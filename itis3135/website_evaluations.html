        <h2>Web Evaluations</h2>
        <p>
            Listed below are two websites that are critiqued by CRAP. CRAP stands for:
            <ul class="sub-ul">
                <li><strong style="color: #a9c1c5;">C</strong>ontrast</li>
                <li><strong style="color: #a9c1c5;">R</strong>epetition</li>
                <li><strong style="color: #a9c1c5;">A</strong>lignment</li>
                <li><strong style="color: #a9c1c5;">P</strong>roximity</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Two websites broken down by the CRAP principle.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Good Website: <a href="https://spotify.design/" target="_blank">Spotify Design</a></h3>
        <p>Spotify Design is a website that shows a visual of the the design community for spotify.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast</strong>: There is a variety of colors that make the website very vibrant, but the text is is always contrasting the background color and it allows the user to see the text clearly.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Repetition</strong>: The website has clear sections divided through the website as the user scrolls down. The division can be seen with a background color change.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Alignment</strong>: There are very clear margins from top, down, left and right that makes the page look well rounded.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Proximity</strong>: The website has a lot of attention to proximity allowing enough space for all the content to make sure the user feels comfortable with the space.</li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Bad Website: <a href="https://charlotte.craigslist.org/" target="_blank">Craigslist</a></h3>
        <p>Craigslist is a website that allows users to view and post advertisements for almost anything.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast</strong>: The website has the default colors for links and backgrounds which make the overall first impression very plain.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Repetition</strong>: Every is very plain looking so the colors, alignment, column placements are repeating.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Alignment</strong>: The links are aligned to the left of the columns. There is a margin from the left and right which push the columns to the center a bit.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Proximity</strong>: All the content in the website have a very close proximity making the website feel cramped.</li>
            </ul>
