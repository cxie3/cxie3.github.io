        <p>
            There are a variety of pot shapes that succulent plants can use to fit in.  <br>
            The right pot needs to be used for the succulent plant to fit and effectively take up the water in the soil.

        <ul>
            <li>Terracotta: breathable, promotes good water drainage and air circulation. Heavy and difficult to transport.</li><br>
            <li>Ceramic: breathable, promotes good water drainage and air circulation.  Heavy and difficult to transport.</li><br>
            <li>Metal: Good for short-term, temporary potting. Gains heat too quickly and temperatures in soil fluctuates easily. Not good for long term plotting.</li><br>
            <li>Resin: good for big plants, lighter to carry and transport.</li><br>
            <li>Plastic: good for big plants, lighter to carry and transport.</li><br>
