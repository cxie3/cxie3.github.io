		<h1>Sleep Deprivation</h1>
		<p>Sleep deprivation, also known as sleep insufficiency or sleeplessness,
			is the condition of not having adequate duration and/or quality of sleep to
			support decent alertness, performance, and health. It can be either chronic
			or acute and may vary widely in severity.
		</p>

			<h3>Causes</h3>
			<div>
            <p>Insomnia, one of the six types of dyssomnia, affects 21â€“37% of the adult population.
			Many of its symptoms are easily recognizable, including excessive daytime sleepiness;
			frustration or worry about sleep; problems with attention, concentration, or memory;
			extreme mood changes or irritability; lack of energy or motivation; poor performance 
			at school or work; and tension headaches or stomach aches.
        </div>
		<h3>Effects and consequences</h3>
		<div>
			<p> 
				Sleep deprivation can have a negative impact on mood. 
				Staying up all night or taking an unexpected night shift can make one feel irritable. 
				Once one catches up on sleep, one's mood will often return to baseline or normal. 
				Even partial sleep deprivation can have a significant impact on mood. In one study, 
				subjects reported increased sleepiness, fatigue, confusion, tension, and total mood disturbance,
				which all recovered to their baseline after one to two full nights of sleep.
			</p>
		</div>
		<h3>Management</h3>
		<div>
			<p>
				Although there are numerous causes of sleep deprivation, there are some 
				fundamental measures that promote quality sleep as suggested by organizations 
				such as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institute of Health, 
				the National Institute of Aging, and the American Academy of Family Physicians. 
				The key is to implement healthier sleep habits, also known as sleep hygiene.
